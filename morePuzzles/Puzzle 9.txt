MSTORE starting will store at memory offset 0
a 32 byte value, in this case the CALLVALUE that you pass in.

SHA3 takes 2 inputs
Stack input
offset: byte offset in the memory.
size: byte size to read in the memory.

[00, 20]

Stack output
hash: Keccak-256 hash of the given data in memory.

produces 20 byte size Keccak-256 hash starting at 0 in memory

SHR
Stack input
shift: number of bits to shift to the right.
value: 32 bytes to shift.

Stack output
value >> shift: the shifted value. If shift is bigger than 255, returns 0.


Whatever CALLVALUE we pass in will be turned into a 20 byte SHA3 hash,
and then shifted right by F8, if this is equal to A8 we solve this puzzle.
